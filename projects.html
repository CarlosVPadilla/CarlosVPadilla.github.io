<h2><a href="http://www.codesin.cl/Jupiter/web/colegios">SieteNet by Codesin</a></h2>

{% include imagelink.html file="/images/static/notascodesin.png" max-width="200px" alt="Grading module" %}
<p>
    Starting year 2012 I restructured Codesin's school management system, which recently adquired the name of SieteNet.
</p>
<p>
    Made with Symfony 2.3, it is a robust platform for the management of educational establishments of any kind. It allows registry
    and reporting of gradings, attendance, records, observations, late arrivals, and as a communication tool for legal tutors.
</p>
<p>
    Most importantly? It delivers calmness to tutors and improves the management of schools.

<h2><a href="http://www.metricarts.com/">TunnelArts by MetricArts</a></h2>
<p>
    During 2017 I worked for MetricArts (and you really should ask them for all your data analysis needs, they're the best). My work
    involved a multiplatform application (Android and web through .NET) called TunnelArts, an excellent tool for the registry of
    progresses in urban digging and predictions about those progresses.

<h2><a href="http://www.youngschool.cl/">Iquique Young School Website</a></h2>
{% include imagelink.html file="/images/static/iys_drupal.png" max-width="200px" alt="Iquique Young School Website" %}
<p>
    On a personal basis, Iquique Young School from the aforementioned city of Iquique, Chile, commissioned me with a website for them.
    It is made with Drupal 7 and completely configured for a customized usage, and it is also responsive on top of that.

<h2>Thesis Work - Multiagent Dispatch System</h2>
{% include imagelink.html file="/images/static/mas.png" max-width="200px" alt="PlaSMA - Simulator for Multiagent Systems" %}
<p>
    My thesis work is about artificial intelligente. More specifically, intelligent agents. It deals with the simulation of an open-pit mine,
    alongside with trucks and shovels that interact with each other, as well as all related negotiation processes. The tools used for this
    project are Java, JADE framework for agent development, and PlaSMA to simulate the mine.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/CarlosVPadilla/CarlosVPadilla.github.io">This website</a></h2>
<p>
    Yes, this website is one of my projects. Made with Jekyll, you can check its source code on the title's link. If you want a concrete example on my
    programming capabilities, this example should answer all your questions.
