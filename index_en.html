            I have developed web systems with Symfony, WebAPIs with C#, and I know the MVC
            pattern deeply. I can develop commerce- and industry-grade, high complexity
            systems. I can also deal with other types of frameworks, just ask!

        {% include servicecard.html title="Web Development" text=webdevtext %}

            Drupal is probably the most versatile CMS there is, and for this reason it is also the most complex out there. I can implement
            your website with Drupal, completely original, no templates used. I can also use other CMS if you wish so.
        {% endcapture %}
        {% include servicecard.html title="Websites" text=webpagetext %}

            I have developed for Android, simulations in Java and even analysis in Python. This
            demonstrates my versatility and I will always make sure the objectives of your company are accomplished.
            If you need any other type of development, I can deal with any challenge.
