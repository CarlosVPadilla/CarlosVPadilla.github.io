<h2>What I can do for you</h2>

<h3>Web Development</h3>
<p>
    I have developed web systems with Symfony for years. Symfony is a robust web development framework, special for commercial grade
    and high complexity systems. I can also deal with any other types of frameworks, just ask me.
</p>

<h3>Websites</h3>
<p>
    Drupal is probably the most versatile CMS there is, and for this reason it is also the most difficult one to learn. I can implement
    a system with Drupal and even design your website, no templates used. I can also use other CMS.
</p>

<h3>Other Types of Development</h3>
<p>
    I am a versatile developer and I will always make sure the objectives of your company are accomplished. If you need any other type
    of development, I can deal with any challenge.
