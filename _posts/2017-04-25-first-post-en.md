This is my first blog post! It has been a time since I had the idea of opening a blog, and here I am, writing the first few letters of my personal blog. In
this blog I intend to post all the things I learn on my way. And I learn a lot of things!

What things do I learn, you ask? I am currently learning about machine learning and big data, but I also learn about programming things in different languages.
Java, PHP, Python... If there is something worth posting about whatever I develop, I will. It is something both for my own good and to contribute to the
community, and the sole idea of doing that excites me.

I will come back with further content! For now, I thank you for the time you took reading this brief introduction.
