<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="/images/static/DSC_0008.JPG" alt="Carlos Vergara" width="150px">
<p>
    I am Carlos Vergara. I am a graduate, with a degree as a Licensee in Engineering Sciences (equivalent to a Bachelor of Science in
    Computer Science) and currently working on my thesis to opt to the degree of Civil Engineering in Computer Sciences and Information
    Systems, at Universidad Arturo Prat in Iquique, Chile (you can learn more about my thesis at my projects page). Currently I live in the
    calm city of Quilpué, in the Region of Valparaíso.

    My specialty is developing custom web systems, and my work is noticeable for its quality. You can check
    <a href="https://github.com/CarlosVPadilla/CarlosVPadilla.github.io">this website's source code</a> if you have any doubts.
    I am also responsible and committed, I can assure you your solution will be done within time and budget, and always taking
    your main objectives in account over everything.
</p>
<p>
    I am a versatile developer. You think I may not know something? Just watch as I learn about your business or technology and how
    I adopt it without any noticeable difference with an experienced developer. I can deal with any challenge you give to me.
</p>
<p>
    I am bilingual and I speak English fluently (and you can notice this wasn't translated using an automatic translator).
    If you need something done in English or if you do not speak Spanish, it's fine, we can communicate without any barriers.
