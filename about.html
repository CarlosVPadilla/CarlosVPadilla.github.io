<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="/images/static/DSC_0008.JPG" alt="Carlos Vergara" width="150px">
<p>
    My name is Carlos Vergara. I am a graduate, with a degree as a Licensee in Engineering Sciences (equivalent to a Bachelor of Science in
    Computer Science) and currently working (and finishing at last!) on my thesis to opt to the degree of Civil Engineering in Computer 
    Sciences and Information Systems, at Universidad Arturo Prat in Iquique, Chile (you can learn more about my thesis at my projects page). 
    Currently I live in the calm city of Quilpué, in the Region of Valparaíso.

<p>
    My specialty is developing custom web systems, and my work is noticeable for its quality. You can check
    <a href="https://github.com/CarlosVPadilla/CarlosVPadilla.github.io">this website's source code</a> for an example about my capabilities.
    I am also responsible and committed, I can assure you your solution will be done within time and budget, and always taking
    your main objectives in account over everything.
</p>
<p>
    I am a versatile developer. I know technologies as varied as PHP, which I worked with for more than 5 years, and Java, which I used
    for my thesis work. I have also worked with Python, SQL, C#, and even developed on Android. I know many technologies and I can easily
    adapt to about any business.
</p>
<p>
    I am bilingual and I speak English fluently (and you can tell this was not translated using an automatic translator).
    If you need something done in English or if you do not speak Spanish, it's fine, we can communicate without any barriers.
</p>
<p>
    I am currently seeking for new career challenges. If you are interested on my profile, do not hesitate on contacting me. You can find my
    contact information at the footer of this page.
